## Game objective:  
Get fleet (well at least one ship) back to the home world

## Background:
The time has come for our fleet to make its way to a legendary planet, circling a far-away star: our home planet of Klamath. The route is treacherous, however, and Bearlon ambushers threaten us at every turn. Years at the head of your school have prepared you for this. It is your mission to lead us, constantly ready to jump out of reach of Bearlon firepower, ensuring at all costs that some portion of our fleet make it through.
